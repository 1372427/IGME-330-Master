# HW - *Cage Clicker* Part IV

- In this chapter we will finish up the game.
- The game works fine, but it has a real problem, it's fairly easy to get a perfect score, but only if the player is patient enough to wait for a "safe" time to click. This is a tedious and boring way to play a game - so let's fix this issue!

## I. Reason for adding a countdown timer

- To make the game more interesting, we are going to give the player a certain number of seconds per level to click on all of the cages.
- If they successfully do so before the time is up, then they will get full points. 
- But if they fail to click on all of the cages in time, penalty points will begin to accrue, 1 per second.
- Thus the "tedious and boring" strategy of waiting fo the perfect moment to click will fail, and the player will be forced to take risks.
