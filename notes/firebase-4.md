# 4 - Firebase "Draw & Share" App

## I. Overview

- We are going to take a slimmed down version of the [HW-drawing-app.md](./HW-drawing-app.md) we did at the beginning of the semester, and give it the  ability to save to Firebase's Realtime Database!
- This will enable users to share their drawings with others
