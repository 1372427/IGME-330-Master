# HW - Word Cloud

## I. Overview
- Extend our word counting demo and create a canvas word cloud 
- if you extend and polish this HW assignment, it could make a nice portfolio piece

## II. Requirements

- use the canvas API and state properties and methods such as `.fillText()`, `.fillStyle`, `.font`, `textAlign` and `textBaseline`
- limit the number of words that you draw in the cloud to something manageable - say between 10 and 25
- More frequent words appear larger than smaller words
- Be sure to specify a minimum font size of the words you draw
- Extras (not required, but if you have time):
  - don't let the words appear on top of each other 
  - animated words?
  
## III. Example
  
  - Nothing too fancy here - consider this the MVP expected for the HW assignment
  - P.S. The corpus is *The Call of Cthulhu*
