# 2 - Procedural Poetry

- Last time we looked at six! different ways to bring unstructured (plain) text into our JS applications
- We also looked at using various string operations to manipulate text, and built as a HW assignment built a "palindrome detector"
- This time we will look at some techniques for generating procedural text that can be used as part of a creative work

## I. The Diastic method
- The diastic method is a method for generating procedural text that was created by Jackson Mac Low. It generates output (a stream of words) which can form the basis of a finished poem or text. 
- This output is derived from two inputs:
  - The first input is the *source text*, from which all of the words in the output are taken. In our example below it an expert from Poe's *The Fall of the House of Usher*
  - The second input is the *seed text*, typically a sentence or two in length. In our example below the seed is the first name's of this semster's 330 instructors
- The rules of diastic method are as follows (and can either be done "by hand", or with a computer as we are doing):
