Written Midterm Exam Notes
When: Thursday 3/17 - the end of week 8 (if you miss the exam because of GDC, you need to send me an email in advance, and you can take the make-up week 9.)

What is covered: Everything we've covered this semester so far, either in the Study Guides, in-class exercises, or lectures/demos is fair game.

What else?: 
- No make up's allowed without prior permission.
- The exam may fill up the entire class time. If you have accommodations for extra test time, I recommend you contact the testing center and have them send me an envelope so that you can take the exam at their testing location.
