# Randomness

- "Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness
- One of our themes for this course will be looking at what role randomness can play in the creation of interactive experiences.

## I. The Dada movement

The Dada art movement from the early 20th century was an "anti-art" movement that challenged conventional notions of aesthetics and cultural norms. It came into being in reaction to the horrors of World War I, and the bourgeois culture that was blamed on bringing the war about.  Pure reason and logic were seen as having failed the world. Dadist works often seemed designed to offend and reject logic, while embracing chaos and irrationality. The techniques they used include:

- Collage
- Cut-up technique
- Photomontage
- Assemblage
- Readymades

## II. Dada - Chance & Randomness

"The official belief in the infallability of reason, logic and causality seemed to us senseless - as senseless as the destruction of the world and the systematic elemination of every particle of human feeling."
