# Randomness

- "Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness
- One of our themes for this course will be looking at what role randomness can play in the creation of interactive experiences.

## I. The Dada movement

The Dada art movement from the early 20th century was an "anti-art" movement that challenged conventional notions of aesthetics and cultural norms. It came into being in reaction to the horrors of World War I, and the bourgeois culture that was blamed on bringing the war about.  Pure reason and logic were seen as having failed the world. Dadist works often seemed designed to offend and reject logic, while embracing chaos and irrationality. The techniques they used include:

- Collage
- Cut-up technique
- Photomontage
- Assemblage
- Readymades

## II. Dada - Chance & Randomness

"The official belief in the infallability of reason, logic and causality seemed to us senseless - as senseless as the destruction of the world and the systematic elemination of every particle of human feeling. This was the reason why were were forced to look for something that would re-establish our humanity. What we needed to find was a balance between heaven and hell. A new unity combining chance and design." - Hans Richter

How "To make a Dadaist Poem" (1920):

- Take a newspaper.
- Take some scissors.
- Choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.
- Cut out the article.
- Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.
- Shake gently.
- Next take out each cutting one after the other.
- Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
- The poem will resemble you.
- And there you are - an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.
