# Randomness

- "Randomness is the lack of pattern or predictability in events." - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness
- One of our themes for this course will be looking at what role randomness can play in the creation of interactive experiences.

## I. The Dada movement

The Dada art movement from the early 20th century was an "anti-art" movement that challenged conventional notions of aesthetics and cultural norms. It came into being in reaction to the horrors of World War I, and the bourgeois culture that was blamed on bringing the war about.  Pure reason and logic were seen as having failed the world. 

Dadist works often seem designed to offend and reject logic, while embracing chaos and irrationality. The techniques they used include:

- Collage
- Cut-up technique
- Photomontage
- Assemblage
- Readymades

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dada#Art_techniques_developed

## II. Dada - Chance & Randomness

The Collage and Cut-up techiques frequently involved the use of randomness in the creation of artistic works. **Watch this video -->**  *Dada - Chance & Randomness* (4:05) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k40U4UPiiPs

The narration at the beginning of this video is hard to understand - here it is:

"The official belief in the infallability of reason, logic and causality seemed to us senseless - as senseless as the destruction of the world and the systematic elemination of every particle of human feeling. This was the reason why were were forced to look for something that would re-establish our humanity. What we needed to find was a balance between heaven and hell. A new unity combining chance and design." - Hans Richter


## III. Jean Arp

Jean Arp (work seen in video above) was a Dadaist German-French sculptor, painter, poet, and abstract artist in other media such as torn and pasted paper. 

Works:
- **Check out** *Untitled* (Collage with Squares Arranged according to the Laws of Chance)
1916â€“17 --> https://www.moma.org/collection/works/37013?artist_id=11&locale=en&page=1&sov_referrer=artist
- **Also see** *According to the Laws of Chance* --> https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-according-to-the-laws-of-chance-t05005
- **And** --> https://www.guggenheim.org/artwork/artist/jean-arp

It was pointed out in the video above that his collage of squares did not appear to be fully random, but instead was curated by modifying where the pieces of paper dropped, or was created many times until an interesting arrangment of squares presented itself. 

## IV. Tristan Tzara

Tristan Tzara (work seen in video above) was a Romanian and French avant-garde poet, essayist and performance artist. He is best known for being one of the founders and central figures of the Dada movement. He was the pioneer to the "cut up" method of creating procedural text.

How "To make a Dadaist Poem" (1920):

- Take a newspaper.
- Take some scissors.
- Choose from this paper an article the length you want to make your poem.
- Cut out the article.
- Next carefully cut out each of the words that make up this article and put them all in a bag.
- Shake gently.
- Next take out each cutting one after the other.
- Copy conscientiously in the order in which they left the bag.
- The poem will resemble you.
- And there you are - an infinitely original author of charming sensibility, even though unappreciated by the vulgar herd.

You may have heard of the author William Burroughs and his *Naked Lunch* novel, which also utilized this cut-up method.

## V. Automatism

*Automatism* refers to creating art without conscious thought, accessing material from the unconscious mind as part of the creative process - https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/automatism

- Check out *Danger of Death* by Jean Arp - which uses "earthquake lines" to produce an apparently random drawing --> https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/arp-danger-of-death-t05007
- As with his collage of squares above, there are indications of premeditation (fainter pencil marks and partial erasures) that suggest that the work is not fully random.

## VI. Moving to the digital realm

Georg Nees was a German academic who was a pioneer of computer art and generative graphics. 
We can approximate many of these techniques digitally:
